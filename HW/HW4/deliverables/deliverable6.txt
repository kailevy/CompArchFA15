  The '<<' operator is a left shift. A 32-bit decoder will have exactly one bit as 1,
and the rest 0s, and only if enable is on. Thus, we take the enable value and shift it
left by the address. As a results, we will get a 1 (given that enable is on) at the bit
equal to the address, and the rest of the bits will be 0s.
